\chapter{CI/CD}
\label{ch:p1:cicd}

This section describes the continuous integration testing and deployment pipeline of openQxD's development repository\cite{gitlab:openqxd-devel}. At the time of writing this thesis the repository is private. As part of the goals of the PASC project\cite{pasc:project} as thus as part of this thesis, we employ CI/CD paradigms into the development workflow of openQxD.
