\chapter*{Declaration of Originality}

I, Roman Gruber, declare hereby that the contents of this thesis are based on my research at ETH Zürich.
The work and results presented in this document have been produced by me in conjunction with my supervisor Prof. Marina Krstić Marinković, other members of the Computational Lattice Field Theory research group in Zürich, members associated to the PASC project~\cite{online:pasc2021} and members of the \RCstar collaboration.
I confirm that I have not submitted any part of this work for another degree or qualification anywhere else.

The contents of \cref{part:gpu} are partly relying on ref.~\citeOwn{pasc24} which is currently unpublished, but we plan to publish in the near future.
Small parts where published in the conference proceeding ref.~\citeOwn{lattice24:roman}.

The contents of \cref{part:variance} are based on an early and incomplete conference proceeding ref.~\citeOwn{lattice23:lma}, whereas most of the results rely on ref.~\citeOwn{mglma}.
Some of the plots are taken from ref.~\citeOwn{mglma}, if so it is indicated specifically in the respective captions.
